# Simple Markdown Parser
The following is a minimalistic Ruby implementation of a markdown compiler, it
translates markdown to HTML.

For a full series on how this compiler works,

The main purpose of this library is to explain basic compiler design techniques
so it's not made to be fast, but easy to read and understand.

For more information about the project, or if you are interested in learning how
to write compilers from scratch, see [the blog post series at Beezwax's blog](https://blog.beezwax.net/2017/07/07/writing-a-markdown-compiler/).
